3,"- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.","-You will be in charge of all purchasing activity, all service providers, and floor manager responsibilities for both day shift and night shift employees.
-They will give you no raise and then tell you that you are choosing to not like the compensation plan
-A large portion of your compensation is tied to stock, that you can only receive once a year. Even though they agreed to your plan upon hiring, they will say you are getting a raise on an annual basis even though they absolutely know that you can not invest or pay bills with restricted stock units. If you dont survive until stock pay out, then you do not receive any of the compensation related to your shares.

-You will likely not meet any of these bosses face to face at all during their time as one of your managers.
-You will have atleast 5 hours a week of meetings that have zero relevance for you.
-You dont participate in your own performance review at all
-Turn over at a management level is so high, leadership may have no idea of the extra work and initiatives you supported outside your role",0.6739
4,"No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.","Despite Amazon being a great company, the Language Engineering role is not all it is cracked up to be. Forget ML and state of the art NLP: leadership at Amazon has determined that Lang Engineers must author deterministic FSTs while scientists do the hard NLP. Also the tooling for Lang Eng is terrible. You will be building 1980s grammars with unforgiving tooling that will cause you great frustration. They recently changed the role guidelines to say that you need advanced degree in computational linguistics which is ironic as the ideal person for this role needs extraordinary patience with applying command line tools and about the level of linguistic knowledge that comes from having a general interest in it. Another disadvantage is there are fewer than 5 Level 6 Lang Engs in Amazon and getting promoted to that level is near impossible. There are no Principal Lang Engs and the role guideline doesn’t have a category for it. Hence many people try to transfer to other roles but authoring FSTs is very limited and not very transferable for science or SDE, so you need a supportive manager and an unburdened team to find you relevant non core projects to work on.",0.4811

7,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey. This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon. The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism. Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.","Work environment is one of the worst I've experienced. My experience may be a bit biased due to the boss I have, but from everything I've heard from friends in the same career, it's more common than not to have the same experience. The disconnect between management and operations is astronomical. Each person is truly treated like a number and the sole objective of everyone above you is to get to the next level, and not create a happy work environment. You will be thrown under the bus if it saves another person's career, without hesitation. 
Along with this is the category of pay. Since Amazon is such a large company, a large portion of your pay is composed of stocks. I was promised, in my hiring contract, that I would start earning my portion of stocks on my one-year anniversary. Little did I know, in reality it takes 2 years for you to start earning this portion of your salary.
Finally, they prevent the people who deserve it most from being promoted. This sentence does not apply to me, but the people I work with. Some of my coworkers have been with the company for over 4 or 5 years and management refuses to promote them due to a ""language disconnect"". Funny enough, everyone but management and operations leaders seem to understand them just fine with no problems. 
The company is composed of lies and disconnections in all levels of work.",0.6326
8,"Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon.

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long.","Every single company you go to is going to have cons. There will ALWAYS be days you run to job search websites and apply to new jobs like crazy. In my own experience, Amazon's pros far outweigh the cons. I've had a lot more great days than bad ones. In all honesty... my biggest con was from being an HR rep for a site. No matter how hard you tried to make everyone happy there were still a small number of associates that were always incredibly unhappy or ungrateful for the effort we put in to make their work life enjoyable or at least tolerable. My only other con I can think of is some of my promotions took much longer than they should have BUT I'm cognizant of several of my own factors that slowed the process. At first I had my own growth I needed to work on. Also, at Amazon you move a lot faster not only with a degree but most importantly if you are willing to relocate. That's for the simple fact that your odds are greater when you are open to more locations. Whereas staying to one site you are limited to what they have available.",0.6472
9,"After 3 years of working with the company you ""cap out"" at $15.75, meaning you can no longer make any more money than that as a tier 1 associate. Your expected to want to move up in the company and that is the only way to make a better hourly wage, by advancing into management and operations management positions if there are any openings.","You do not matter. You are 100% replaceable. How well you do your job will not help you advance as an associate, favoritism is rampant. The management does not know what they are doing as most are hired right out of college and a trained by managers with about 3 weeks experience with the company, the associate who have 2+ years of experience are used to maintain numbers and most the work load is in turned dumped onto them( L1’s are expected to pick/stow/pack at a faster rate then the ones with less experience but the new associates are not expected to ever reach the same rate. ) Process assistants regularly do the jobs of area managers as the AM’s regularly dump most of their work onto PA’s so they can continue gossiping with each other in conference rooms while claiming to be discussing business metrics however never discussing anything remotely related to work for hours on end. HR is not there to help you when you need help they are there to make sure management level personnel doesn’t get the company sued so you will be let go without hesitation if there is a issue with management. The only way you will move up in this company is by kissing butt your performance has as much influence as your ability to walk.",0.5844

Other than the stock, the base pay and benefits such as 401k match and PTO are terrible, lagging behind any other similar company in the area and industry.

Certain areas of the building or even different sites are given better or worse treatment depending on who the management is, when upper management makes a promise to the employees to get out early you can bet that they're just lying to get you to work harder.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible.

Each person is truly treated like a number and the sole objective of everyone above you is to get to the next level, and not create a happy work environment. You will be thrown under the bus if it saves another person's career, without hesitation. 
Along with this is the category of pay. Since Amazon is such a large company, a large portion of your pay is composed of stocks. I was promised, in my hiring contract, that I would start earning my portion of stocks on my one-year anniversary. Little did I know, in reality it takes 2 years for you to start earning this portion of your salary.
Finally, they prevent the people who deserve it most from being promoted. This sentence does not apply to me, but the people I work with.

The management people I was working with repeatedly made homosexual advances in the workplace... Just because you're in a higher position, doesn't mean the sexual harassment policies don't apply to you! Pathetic. Made working there very uncomfortable. 
When I attempted to alert their bosses, they'll would give me falsified contact information because they didn't want to get reported, or get on the one who is doing the harassing's ""bad side"" which is very selfish. Overall, I would work here again because of the consistent pay, benefits, etc...

I will make sure I don't alert other authorities there about the sexual harassment in-person (only online via phone call or email) because a lot of times, the supervisors are very aware of how important the job is to them and most-likely will change the narrative of the story. Also, the managers would pull just about every worker in the station about their ""time off task"" however, everyone who was working there at the time knew that a good amount of the time, the restrooms were closed due to either 1)spot-cleaning or 2)construction/deep-cleaning maintenance. This is very unprofessional for the managers to accuse workers of not working because we'll have been gone for longer than 5-10 minutes due to having to wait in line to use the restaurant and go up and down different floor levels to hopefully find an open restroom! I drunk a lot of water when working because of the highly expected process rate. It's truly a workout, which I am okay with when working at any facility given I've worked at two different facilities thus far(one part-time and one full-time). So, what would I do differently? I would make sure I wait until hired again (because I resigned, have to wait 12 months to be considered to work again when resign, I'm not sure what the policies are when fired, but when resigned, this is the message I received from Amazon) and wait until I find out who my supervisors are, and do research on them to find out who their supervisors are so I am not the only worker their without leverage if those issues occur again therefore, I will have the clear option of reporting any supervisors violating any rules or make the work-environment uncomfortable instead of leaving because THEY'RE the one's in the wrong!",0.6763

Below are the benefit areas that could use some improvement:
* Company Holidays: Amazon does not offer many holidays each year. For example, Black Friday, Christmas Eve, and New Years Eve are not company holidays. Compared to other large companies that I have worked for, Amazon's company holidays are severely lacking and leave me missing the days around the big holidays because I have work. 
* 401K plan match: the Amazon 401K plans do not start matching employee contributions until an employee has worked at the company for 2 years. For such a large company, it is surprising that they don't match some portion of contributions on day one. Most of the companies I have worked at (even retail and small companies) have offered some portion of a 401K match that starts in the first 90 days.","Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey.

I get it they're doing ""computer work"" but every time I turned around they were caught watching Netflix/listening to music while they harass people to work faster.
The management people I was working with repeatedly made homosexual advances in the workplace... Just because you're in a higher position, doesn't mean the sexual harassment policies don't apply to you! Pathetic. Made working there very uncomfortable. 
When I attempted to alert their bosses, they'll would give me falsified contact information because they didn't want to get reported, or get on the one who is doing the harassing's ""bad side"" which is very selfish. Overall, I would work here again because of the consistent pay, benefits, etc... However, next time around I will make sure I keep my distance from the supervisors at OKC1 Facility near Will Rogers Airport, OKC, or any other facility in the states. I will make sure I don't alert other authorities there about the sexual harassment in-person (only online via phone call or email) because a lot of times, the supervisors are very aware of how important the job is to them and most-likely will change the narrative of the story. Also, the managers would pull just about every worker in the station about their ""time off task"" however, everyone who was working there at the time knew that a good amount of the time, the restrooms were closed due to either 1)spot-cleaning or 2)construction/deep-cleaning maintenance. This is very unprofessional for the managers to accuse workers of not working because we'll have been gone for longer than 5-10 minutes due to having to wait in line to use the restaurant and go up and down different floor levels to hopefully find an open restroom! I drunk a lot of water when working because of the highly expected process rate. It's truly a workout, which I am okay with when working at any facility given I've worked at two different facilities thus far(one part-time and one full-time). So, what would I do differently? I would make sure I wait until hired again (because I resigned, have to wait 12 months to be considered to work again when resign, I'm not sure what the policies are when fired, but when resigned, this is the message I received from Amazon) and wait until I find out who my supervisors are, and do research on them to find out who their supervisors are so I am not the only worker their without leverage if those issues occur again therefore, I will have the clear option of reporting any supervisors violating any rules or make the work-environment uncomfortable instead of leaving because THEY'RE the one's in the wrong!",0.5683

Very very limited paid-time vacation pay; the majority of the vacation time is unpaid.
Supervisors hound you to make sure you process ""x"" amount of items per hour, while they sit down in a chair. 
I get it they're doing ""computer work"" but every time I turned around they were caught watching Netflix/listening to music while they harass people to work faster.
The management people I was working with repeatedly made homosexual advances in the workplace... Just because you're in a higher position, doesn't mean the sexual harassment policies don't apply to you! Pathetic. Made working there very uncomfortable. 
When I attempted to alert their bosses, they'll would give me falsified contact information because they didn't want to get reported, or get on the one who is doing the harassing's ""bad side"" which is very selfish. Overall, I would work here again because of the consistent pay, benefits, etc... However, next time around I will make sure I keep my distance from the supervisors at OKC1 Facility near Will Rogers Airport, OKC, or any other facility in the states. I will make sure I don't alert other authorities there about the sexual harassment in-person (only online via phone call or email) because a lot of times, the supervisors are very aware of how important the job is to them and most-likely will change the narrative of the story. Also, the managers would pull just about every worker in the station about their ""time off task"" however, everyone who was working there at the time knew that a good amount of the time, the restrooms were closed due to either 1)spot-cleaning or 2)construction/deep-cleaning maintenance. This is very unprofessional for the managers to accuse workers of not working because we'll have been gone for longer than 5-10 minutes due to having to wait in line to use the restaurant and go up and down different floor levels to hopefully find an open restroom! I drunk a lot of water when working because of the highly expected process rate. It's truly a workout, which I am okay with when working at any facility given I've worked at two different facilities thus far(one part-time and one full-time). So, what would I do differently?

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible.

- If you move and work harder with Amazon you lose out on the chance of a small increase in salary because you are kicked out of the review cycle for your previous role and have to wait for the next one in your current job. 
- Amazon does a great PR dance about employee satisfaction but doesn't even meet the qualifications for a good employer let alone a great one. 
- Amazon saves millions since the pandemic having employees working from home and at the start they gave bonuses etc but now nothing. I pay for my own internet, office supplies, etc. and make the same wage I started at 3 years ago. 
- Amazon doesn't care about turn over if you are not performing the improvement plans are aggressive and you get fired very quickly if Amazon would truly invest they could save enough in turn over to give all employees a pay increase.","I have been with Amazon for over 7 years. A year in the position I am in now. While Amazon has consistently been raising their pay wages for their associates over the time I have been here it's not consistent enough with the cost of living or equal to other states even.

They would bring in about $1960 a mth after taxes and everything come out of their checks and a 1 bedroom apartment alone runs anywhere from $1600 to $1900 in Seattle and $1200 to $1600 outside of Seattle.

I get it they're doing ""computer work"" but every time I turned around they were caught watching Netflix/listening to music while they harass people to work faster.
The management people I was working with repeatedly made homosexual advances in the workplace... Just because you're in a higher position, doesn't mean the sexual harassment policies don't apply to you! Pathetic. Made working there very uncomfortable. 
When I attempted to alert their bosses, they'll would give me falsified contact information because they didn't want to get reported, or get on the one who is doing the harassing's ""bad side"" which is very selfish. Overall, I would work here again because of the consistent pay, benefits, etc... However, next time around I will make sure I keep my distance from the supervisors at OKC1 Facility near Will Rogers Airport, OKC, or any other facility in the states. I will make sure I don't alert other authorities there about the sexual harassment in-person (only online via phone call or email) because a lot of times, the supervisors are very aware of how important the job is to them and most-likely will change the narrative of the story.

The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism. Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.",0.4177

-A large portion of your compensation is tied to stock, that you can only receive once a year. Even though they agreed to your plan upon hiring, they will say you are getting a raise on an annual basis even though they absolutely know that you can not invest or pay bills with restricted stock units. If you dont survive until stock pay out, then you do not receive any of the compensation related to your shares.

No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible.

At some point within the last 3 years they started micro-managing every facet of our job and harps on every expenditure despite us turning out record profits every single year.

Unless you're just trying to make a quick dirty buck to get yourself off the ground I would NEVER recommend working here.","It's a very loud and fast paced environment, most of the employees hate their job and are very rude to each other, the company is constantly changing the rules and if you aren't up to date with those rules you can get seriously in trouble or fired for something you didn't know about. Certain areas of the building or even different sites are given better or worse treatment depending on who the management is, when upper management makes a promise to the employees to get out early you can bet that they're just lying to get you to work harder.

Finance uses outdated and cumbersome financial reporting systems, paired with much-too frequent reporting cycles.

Speed is more important than accuracy. 
 Deliverables and timelines come out of nowhere and are at the whim of your VP, where months of challenging work to prepare for a meeting can be made worthless at the literal last minute.

For Amazon Fresh only - it is absolute chaos. No systems, no manager support, it's a heavy ""callout culture,"" meaning people are encouraged to call out others' mistakes in a public forum so that they can look better. Leadership is completely out of tune with the day to day activities of CMs and PMs, they have no grasp of the necessary time and actions required to complete one of their asks. 

 I feel like I am constantly just spinning my wheels and getting nothing accomplished. Really cool project, but Fresh needs a significant culture change in order to move forward. Apply at your own risk - I would strongly recommend using a role at Amazon Fresh as an opportunity to get your foot in the door at Amazon, then rotate to a new org ASAP. Do not work on this org for any more than 1 year.

* No integrity in leadership. My current manager is literally lying to her manager about me simply because I refuse to be a QA Engineer when I was hired as a cyber security engineer.
* Nowhere to go. I’ve escalated my concerns and have received no responses. I am being forced to resign unless I want to endure more punishment from my manager.","Leadership is structured to shield their exposure to accountability by creating arbitrary and invisible moving metrics.

In addition, one needs to get 4-8 feedback requests, then a panel votes on it and your manager either defend you or not. If your manager tells you not to do the promotion process, that means they will not support you. Be prepared to write your own doc as well so the manager can have less work, since writing it can take 1-2 quarters. If you don't get promoted the first time, you can try again the next quarter or two, but having that manager support will be necessary. If your manager changes, it will be more difficult as your new manager can't vouch for you, so another leader will be an enacting overseer. 
Due to the promo process, it may not make sense to switch roles, even if you wanted to.

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible.

Can't take a vacation until worked for at least 12 months.
Very very limited paid-time vacation pay; the majority of the vacation time is unpaid.
Supervisors hound you to make sure you process ""x"" amount of items per hour, while they sit down in a chair. 
I get it they're doing ""computer work"" but every time I turned around they were caught watching Netflix/listening to music while they harass people to work faster.
The management people I was working with repeatedly made homosexual advances in the workplace... Just because you're in a higher position, doesn't mean the sexual harassment policies don't apply to you! Pathetic. Made working there very uncomfortable. 
When I attempted to alert their bosses, they'll would give me falsified contact information because they didn't want to get reported, or get on the one who is doing the harassing's ""bad side"" which is very selfish. Overall, I would work here again because of the consistent pay, benefits, etc... However, next time around I will make sure I keep my distance from the supervisors at OKC1 Facility near Will Rogers Airport, OKC, or any other facility in the states. I will make sure I don't alert other authorities there about the sexual harassment in-person (only online via phone call or email) because a lot of times, the supervisors are very aware of how important the job is to them and most-likely will change the narrative of the story. Also, the managers would pull just about every worker in the station about their ""time off task"" however, everyone who was working there at the time knew that a good amount of the time, the restrooms were closed due to either 1)spot-cleaning or 2)construction/deep-cleaning maintenance. This is very unprofessional for the managers to accuse workers of not working because we'll have been gone for longer than 5-10 minutes due to having to wait in line to use the restaurant and go up and down different floor levels to hopefully find an open restroom! I drunk a lot of water when working because of the highly expected process rate. It's truly a workout, which I am okay with when working at any facility given I've worked at two different facilities thus far(one part-time and one full-time). So, what would I do differently? I would make sure I wait until hired again (because I resigned, have to wait 12 months to be considered to work again when resign, I'm not sure what the policies are when fired, but when resigned, this is the message I received from Amazon) and wait until I find out who my supervisors are, and do research on them to find out who their supervisors are so I am not the only worker their without leverage if those issues occur again therefore, I will have the clear option of reporting any supervisors violating any rules or make the work-environment uncomfortable instead of leaving because THEY'RE the one's in the wrong!",0.4581

320,"Can be difficult to get promoted, all depends on your manager as your manager is supposed to write a paper that shows you have met the job leveling guide requirements for the next level. In addition, one needs to get 4-8 feedback requests, then a panel votes on it and your manager either defend you or not. If your manager tells you not to do the promotion process, that means they will not support you. Be prepared to write your own doc as well so the manager can have less work, since writing it can take 1-2 quarters. If you don't get promoted the first time, you can try again the next quarter or two, but having that manager support will be necessary. If your manager changes, it will be more difficult as your new manager can't vouch for you, so another leader will be an enacting overseer. 
Due to the promo process, it may not make sense to switch roles, even if you wanted to.
It's a male club. As a female on the ProServe Professional Practice, I would not be invited to group outings like skiing/dinners, because they ""forgot."" 

Management would not attend meetings when asked, but then would find out they were in an in person meeting for another team members opportunity.

As an individual who did not have kids, it made it harder as well. Managers/leaders would meet up with team members and their kids.

For Professional Services, time sheets are important and have been part of firing panels where a person was fired over missing one timesheet form their improvement plan.","Rumors of it being a meat grinder are understated. It's an aggressive culture with toxicity promoted by mid level managers (sr. finance and director level) who use it to suppress talent.

Can't take a vacation until worked for at least 12 months.
Very very limited paid-time vacation pay; the majority of the vacation time is unpaid.
Supervisors hound you to make sure you process ""x"" amount of items per hour, while they sit down in a chair. 
I get it they're doing ""computer work"" but every time I turned around they were caught watching Netflix/listening to music while they harass people to work faster.
The management people I was working with repeatedly made homosexual advances in the workplace... Just because you're in a higher position, doesn't mean the sexual harassment policies don't apply to you! Pathetic. Made working there very uncomfortable. 
When I attempted to alert their bosses, they'll would give me falsified contact information because they didn't want to get reported, or get on the one who is doing the harassing's ""bad side"" which is very selfish. Overall, I would work here again because of the consistent pay, benefits, etc... However, next time around I will make sure I keep my distance from the supervisors at OKC1 Facility near Will Rogers Airport, OKC, or any other facility in the states. I will make sure I don't alert other authorities there about the sexual harassment in-person (only online via phone call or email) because a lot of times, the supervisors are very aware of how important the job is to them and most-likely will change the narrative of the story. Also, the managers would pull just about every worker in the station about their ""time off task"" however, everyone who was working there at the time knew that a good amount of the time, the restrooms were closed due to either 1)spot-cleaning or 2)construction/deep-cleaning maintenance. This is very unprofessional for the managers to accuse workers of not working because we'll have been gone for longer than 5-10 minutes due to having to wait in line to use the restaurant and go up and down different floor levels to hopefully find an open restroom! I drunk a lot of water when working because of the highly expected process rate. It's truly a workout, which I am okay with when working at any facility given I've worked at two different facilities thus far(one part-time and one full-time). So, what would I do differently? I would make sure I wait until hired again (because I resigned, have to wait 12 months to be considered to work again when resign, I'm not sure what the policies are when fired, but when resigned, this is the message I received from Amazon) and wait until I find out who my supervisors are, and do research on them to find out who their supervisors are so I am not the only worker their without leverage if those issues occur again therefore, I will have the clear option of reporting any supervisors violating any rules or make the work-environment uncomfortable instead of leaving because THEY'RE the one's in the wrong!","Work environment is one of the worst I've experienced. My experience may be a bit biased due to the boss I have, but from everything I've heard from friends in the same career, it's more common than not to have the same experience. The disconnect between management and operations is astronomical. Each person is truly treated like a number and the sole objective of everyone above you is to get to the next level, and not create a happy work environment. You will be thrown under the bus if it saves another person's career, without hesitation. 
Along with this is the category of pay. Since Amazon is such a large company, a large portion of your pay is composed of stocks. I was promised, in my hiring contract, that I would start earning my portion of stocks on my one-year anniversary. Little did I know, in reality it takes 2 years for you to start earning this portion of your salary.
Finally, they prevent the people who deserve it most from being promoted. This sentence does not apply to me, but the people I work with. Some of my coworkers have been with the company for over 4 or 5 years and management refuses to promote them due to a ""language disconnect"". Funny enough, everyone but management and operations leaders seem to understand them just fine with no problems.

For Amazon Fresh only - it is absolute chaos. No systems, no manager support, it's a heavy ""callout culture,"" meaning people are encouraged to call out others' mistakes in a public forum so that they can look better. Leadership is completely out of tune with the day to day activities of CMs and PMs, they have no grasp of the necessary time and actions required to complete one of their asks. 

 I feel like I am constantly just spinning my wheels and getting nothing accomplished. Really cool project, but Fresh needs a significant culture change in order to move forward. Apply at your own risk - I would strongly recommend using a role at Amazon Fresh as an opportunity to get your foot in the door at Amazon, then rotate to a new org ASAP.

Compensation structure is misleading or predatory.

Promotion process is a nightmare and can take over a year when interviewing into the same position takes a few hours.

Can be incredibly political (managers trying to impress each other)

Teams are incredibly unstable, reorgs are common. At any moment you could be forced under a team/manager that you don't like.

Operations loads (on call) can be incredibly time intensive with no work-life balance when you're on call.","Impostor Syndrome - it is real and palpable! Being around such high performers who are knowledgeable can be very intimidating.

You need to manage your own time... AWS is an environment where you kind of act like you run your own company. You won't have a lot of folks telling you what to do. If you can't handle running your own show, and instead prefer a structured tell-me-what-to-do approach, this is not for you.

Working with partners and customers can be challenging as there can be a bunch of twists and turns and things can take longer than desired. Patience and persistence is required!

Especially if you are working remotely, the job can get a bit lonely... so if you are really looking for a lot of interactions with folks, this might not be the role for you

Can sometimes get bombarded with meetings. Work with your team and your leader to set appropriate boundaries and establish enough headroom for you to get your various bits of work done

If you are opposed to being a constant student, this is NOT the role for you. There is ALWAYS something to learn and explore.

If you do not set expectations with your manager, it will be difficult to progress, since the picture is unclear. Your manager has to present your case, on why amazon should keep you.","Can be difficult to get promoted, all depends on your manager as your manager is supposed to write a paper that shows you have met the job leveling guide requirements for the next level. In addition, one needs to get 4-8 feedback requests, then a panel votes on it and your manager either defend you or not. If your manager tells you not to do the promotion process, that means they will not support you. Be prepared to write your own doc as well so the manager can have less work, since writing it can take 1-2 quarters. If you don't get promoted the first time, you can try again the next quarter or two, but having that manager support will be necessary. If your manager changes, it will be more difficult as your new manager can't vouch for you, so another leader will be an enacting overseer. 
Due to the promo process, it may not make sense to switch roles, even if you wanted to.
It's a male club. As a female on the ProServe Professional Practice, I would not be invited to group outings like skiing/dinners, because they ""forgot.""

Compensation and salary caps that do not adjust for inflation make Amazon less competitive with other employers, particularly when other employers are putting in extra effort to attract and retain talent.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible.

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible.

Working with partners and customers can be challenging as there can be a bunch of twists and turns and things can take longer than desired. Patience and persistence is required!

Especially if you are working remotely, the job can get a bit lonely... so if you are really looking for a lot of interactions with folks, this might not be the role for you

Can sometimes get bombarded with meetings. Work with your team and your leader to set appropriate boundaries and establish enough headroom for you to get your various bits of work done

If you are opposed to being a constant student, this is NOT the role for you. There is ALWAYS something to learn and explore. For folks who feel they need to be comfortable that they know how to do their job, this might NOT be the role for you. Every day is Day 1 at Amazon which means you are constantly working to come up to speed.",0.6492

- Amazon is all about taking self-initiatives and self-learning but this thought doesn't necessarily apply for seeking information in regards to state/governmental policies. HR should reach out to candidates to make them be better informed","Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon.

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long.",0.4683
