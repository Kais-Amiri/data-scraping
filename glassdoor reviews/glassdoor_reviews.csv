You work with smart people, you work on exciting projects, you are pushed to your limits...which can be rewarding when you accomplish great things. The diversity of the potential work and innovation can be very alluring. I've often called Amazon my ""Sexy Mistress...she's emotionally abusive, but she's so sexy that I go back for more punishment.""","The management process is abusive, and I'm currently a manager.

You are forced to ride people and stack rank employees...I've been forced to give good employees bad overall ratings because of politics and stack ranking.","Don't pretend that the recent NY Times article was all about ""isolated incidents"".

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived. You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned. There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
 - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
 - A chance to make a huge difference
 - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
 - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
 - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain","- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.","Stack ranking is a horrible practice since it's rife with favoritism. It's also not Amazonian in that it's not data based (arbitrarily designating a certain percentage of employees that must be put on performance management isn't a data driven criterion) and it's not frugal (effectively forcing an individual out of the company in one division who would make the grade in another is either retaining someone who doesn't meet the bar or a waste of talent). The goal is to force managers to actually make the hard decisions about how their team members compare with each other (not everyone can be exceptional), but it has more defects than virtues. Replace it with a common comparison of each person against the bar for their position, based on data. The percentages that are assigned to each performance category will turn out how they turn out, but there will be an evaluation mechanism that's fair and frugal."
4,5.0,Current Employee,less than 1 year,An Amazing Place to Work,"Feb 23, 2018","Software Development Manager in Phoenix, AZ","Phoenix, AZ","I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.",

7,4.0,Former Employee,more than 5 years,We are now in a world where we are condescended to by our inferiors,"Mar 23, 2017","Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA","Seattle, WA",This company gets A list performance from C list employees. The culture is quick and hard charging. You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey. This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon. The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism. Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.","Bezos you bought the Washington Post and hired Jay Carney to be your PR head.

For those grasping Weasels that have squirmed and back stabbed your way to success, you know who you are. You won't care what is written here because ""You got yours, Eff them.""

For those truly diligent and hard working employees that don't want to believe the story from NY times that called Amazon a ""Snake Pit"" because you don't want to think you actually are involved in such a dystopian landscape of anti-business ethics: ""Always yell with the crowd. It is the only means to be safe."""
8,4.0,,,A huge diverse high tech company with all sorts of stuff,"Sep 19, 2014","Software Development Engineer in Seattle, WA","Seattle, WA","Disclaimer: My opinions reflect that of an SDE in Amazon. Seems like some operational job functions are very tough.

I have read through some of the other Amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience! This is so true. Within the same team, you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together. I think I am more of the balanced type as I try to stay sane. The Amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be.

Pros in Amazon certainly excludes great benefits, but compensation is competitive. Free food means average quality free coffee, once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch, and free beer and finger food in special events. We get a free Orca card to take any bus in the Seattle area for free. $160 per month subsidy for office parking, which is better than nothing. Downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month. 401K contribution is 50% of what you put in, where you can put in max 4% of your salary. Not so great. Staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food, or could be even more expensive. It is hard not to complain about the cafeteria. Vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves. They count as part of your 5 personal days per year. Listing the benefits of Amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros.

Work life balance seems to be ok for the most part, and seems to be individually-driven. No one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time. I have team mates working every night and weekend, and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm, all in the same team. Managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working. If you work 40-hour weeks productively, you can definitely outperform someone who works 60-hour weeks but don't deliver stuff. Working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common, but I can't say how many people are working how long. The view on work life balance is a bit skewed. All it comes down to are the managers and what they think. Projects are always never-ending but I have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable, without counting your nights and weekends. Getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment. Everyone needs a break.

On-call really really sucks. Basically all it comes down to is having SDEs double-duty as support operations engineers. Note that on-call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way. The on-call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team, and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons. If the managers had given more time to up the quality, there would not be so many problems. Software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years. The code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds. Innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in Amazon. Searching through the Amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse.

Integration is the name of the game in Amazon. You will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team's services. Whether these other people are cooperative is a hit-or-miss. I have found that most people are responsive and helpful, but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody. It is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive.

Amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow. This reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit. If the company does not make money, where is our bonus going to come from? You can see new faces around the Amazon building almost everyday! Downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above-average engineers and being an Amazonian SDE certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names. Amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people. I think the world is not turning up enough SDEs and the only way is for quality to go downhill.

As an SDE, expect to spend most of your time talking, writing emails and documents, and maybe around 20-30% of your time coding. In most of the teams, you can work on interesting projects, but probably not revolutionary ones. Note that Amazon is a very down-to-earth company and the work is very down-to-earth as well. You will work on real things that people have actually requested for, and that people will start using as soon as you are done. Work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff. Most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems. To me, this seems to make sense because I have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and I did not feel it was a good use of my time.

Internal mobility is a key strength of Amazon, and I am not sure which company has done better than Amazon in this aspect. Internal moves are easy. You only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team. There is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time!

Seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the Bay area.

Overall Amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work. The flexibility of this company is really its core strength. You have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want. Bummer. You shouldn't be slacking!","Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon.

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long.",The thing about thinking long-term is getting more and more worrying as the company has not turned a tidy profit and is trying to conquer the world with its lofty expansion strategies. I don't know what kind of secret recipe management is cooking but seeing the company not making much money never feels comfortable.

Forget ML and state of the art NLP: leadership at Amazon has determined that Lang Engineers must author deterministic FSTs while scientists do the hard NLP. Also the tooling for Lang Eng is terrible. You will be building 1980s grammars with unforgiving tooling that will cause you great frustration. They recently changed the role guidelines to say that you need advanced degree in computational linguistics which is ironic as the ideal person for this role needs extraordinary patience with applying command line tools and about the level of linguistic knowledge that comes from having a general interest in it. Another disadvantage is there are fewer than 5 Level 6 Lang Engs in Amazon and getting promoted to that level is near impossible. There are no Principal Lang Engs and the role guideline doesn’t have a category for it. Hence many people try to transfer to other roles but authoring FSTs is very limited and not very transferable for science or SDE, so you need a supportive manager and an unburdened team to find you relevant non core projects to work on.",The lack of women in senior roles at Amazon is glaring.

At least the team or org that I stayed, I don't need to worry about making contribution at all during this period of time. It allows me to observe what the team does and how the team does things, also many courses are very useful to help any SDE to become an excellent engineering.

5. The culture and working environment expect you to be leader of your own, and make contribution to the team, the org or even broader impact. I would recommend someone who knows what he/she wants, or self-motivated enough to join.

The unheard of annual employee churn (150%, see NYT article) speaks for itself.","Focusing everything to be the world's most customer obsessed company has created enormous growth and value to shareholders, but at the direct expense of your employees. Shift some focus away from dominating commerce to valuing employees at all levels of the organization. Put more weight on manager performance by the reviews from their team members. Delivering results at all costs can crush and demoralize your workforce."

* Global-Scale Challenges: Amazon and AWS operate in a worldwide scope and providing the best for customers brings challenges that will really allow someone to do the best work of their life. 

* Brilliant Coworkers: Amazon prides itself on hiring and retaining the best. This couldn't be more true! The folks that I work with at Amazon are extremely smart and wise experts in their field. I learn from them everyday and get the opportunity to share my expertise and mentor others. 

* Meaningful Impact: A large portion of the globe knows of Amazon, and a lot are customers. Knowing that the work I do on a daily basis helps people and businesses across the globe is a good feeling. I know I am just a cog in the whole machine, but every person here at Amazon is on a team that impacts (and focuses on) customers in one way or another. The work that I do here is meaningful and makes me proud to be a part of it all.

* Work/Life Balance: I know Amazon has a reputation for not being a place with a good work/life balance, but I have not experienced that. My team (and whole organization) highly values work/life balance and encourages each other to avoid working during off-hours and valuing the personal life balance with work. I don't feel like I have ever been pressured to work extra hours (beyond 40 in a week) or gotten push-back for taking care of myself or loved ones.","Largely, the cons are the benefits offered by Amazon. Amazon has the same benefits offered to their corporate employees, delivery drivers, and warehouse workers. This results in good benefits for warehouse workers and drivers, but below the standard for corporate employees. 

Below are the benefit areas that could use some improvement:
* Company Holidays: Amazon does not offer many holidays each year. For example, Black Friday, Christmas Eve, and New Years Eve are not company holidays. Compared to other large companies that I have worked for, Amazon's company holidays are severely lacking and leave me missing the days around the big holidays because I have work. 
* 401K plan match: the Amazon 401K plans do not start matching employee contributions until an employee has worked at the company for 2 years. For such a large company, it is surprising that they don't match some portion of contributions on day one. Most of the companies I have worked at (even retail and small companies) have offered some portion of a 401K match that starts in the first 90 days.","Comparing Amazon to other large corporations, the company holidays and 401K benefits are below the standard. Amazon has a reputation for working their corporate employees rather hard, and while I have not yet experienced that, expanding the company holidays will help employees take time to recharge and really do the best work of their life."

- Amazon saves millions since the pandemic having employees working from home and at the start they gave bonuses etc but now nothing. I pay for my own internet, office supplies, etc. and make the same wage I started at 3 years ago.

A great job for people who can easily memorize things and aren't concerned with a social life or clear career trajectory.

Training is indefinite to match inconsistent metrics.

They pay you money. and you get days off sometimes. 

If you enjoy endless overly imposing politically correct propaganda veiled as community engagement look no further.

Someday we'll all look back and laugh.","Leadership is structured to shield their exposure to accountability by creating arbitrary and invisible moving metrics. 

No one can coherently describe the job. It's not clear even leadership understands what their role is or the role of the department entirely. Even when flow leads do well they don't seem to know why but try really hard to at pretend they do.

The schedule is unforgiving and will likely make it difficult to engage with a typical social life. Any days you have off are endlessly under threat of mandatory extra time imposed without notice thanks to perpetual understaffing. 

Unproductive mandatory video streamed meetings (conducted while you're actively working) are treated like Youtube livestreams, where middle managers attempt to be zany and entertaining while responding to live chat messages from employees and doling out updates that were already communicated by email.

Anything can be used as a negative ""opportunity"" on your performance review precluding you from any opportunity for transfer into another department you may be better suited for.

When do get promotion, will get 20-50% increase in salary/stocks.","Can be difficult to get promoted, all depends on your manager as your manager is supposed to write a paper that shows you have met the job leveling guide requirements for the next level. In addition, one needs to get 4-8 feedback requests, then a panel votes on it and your manager either defend you or not. If your manager tells you not to do the promotion process, that means they will not support you. Be prepared to write your own doc as well so the manager can have less work, since writing it can take 1-2 quarters. If you don't get promoted the first time, you can try again the next quarter or two, but having that manager support will be necessary. If your manager changes, it will be more difficult as your new manager can't vouch for you, so another leader will be an enacting overseer. 
Due to the promo process, it may not make sense to switch roles, even if you wanted to.
It's a male club. As a female on the ProServe Professional Practice, I would not be invited to group outings like skiing/dinners, because they ""forgot."" 

Management would not attend meetings when asked, but then would find out they were in an in person meeting for another team members opportunity.

As an individual who did not have kids, it made it harder as well. Managers/leaders would meet up with team members and their kids.

For Professional Services, time sheets are important and have been part of firing panels where a person was fired over missing one timesheet form their improvement plan.","Be inclusive and change the promotion process. 
Treat employees that complete 4 years better."
321,2.0,Former Employee,more than 1 year,No vacation time considered until 12 months or longer employment,"Dec 25, 2021","Package Handler in Oklahoma City, OK","Oklahoma City, OK","Decent pay: $15/hr.
Can work part-time or full-time.
Can transfer locations.","They work every energy bar out of you.
Can't take a vacation until worked for at least 12 months.
Very very limited paid-time vacation pay; the majority of the vacation time is unpaid.
Supervisors hound you to make sure you process ""x"" amount of items per hour, while they sit down in a chair. 
I get it they're doing ""computer work"" but every time I turned around they were caught watching Netflix/listening to music while they harass people to work faster.
The management people I was working with repeatedly made homosexual advances in the workplace... Just because you're in a higher position, doesn't mean the sexual harassment policies don't apply to you! Pathetic. Made working there very uncomfortable. 
When I attempted to alert their bosses, they'll would give me falsified contact information because they didn't want to get reported, or get on the one who is doing the harassing's ""bad side"" which is very selfish. Overall, I would work here again because of the consistent pay, benefits, etc... However, next time around I will make sure I keep my distance from the supervisors at OKC1 Facility near Will Rogers Airport, OKC, or any other facility in the states. I will make sure I don't alert other authorities there about the sexual harassment in-person (only online via phone call or email) because a lot of times, the supervisors are very aware of how important the job is to them and most-likely will change the narrative of the story. Also, the managers would pull just about every worker in the station about their ""time off task"" however, everyone who was working there at the time knew that a good amount of the time, the restrooms were closed due to either 1)spot-cleaning or 2)construction/deep-cleaning maintenance. This is very unprofessional for the managers to accuse workers of not working because we'll have been gone for longer than 5-10 minutes due to having to wait in line to use the restaurant and go up and down different floor levels to hopefully find an open restroom! I drunk a lot of water when working because of the highly expected process rate. It's truly a workout, which I am okay with when working at any facility given I've worked at two different facilities thus far(one part-time and one full-time). So, what would I do differently? I would make sure I wait until hired again (because I resigned, have to wait 12 months to be considered to work again when resign, I'm not sure what the policies are when fired, but when resigned, this is the message I received from Amazon) and wait until I find out who my supervisors are, and do research on them to find out who their supervisors are so I am not the only worker their without leverage if those issues occur again therefore, I will have the clear option of reporting any supervisors violating any rules or make the work-environment uncomfortable instead of leaving because THEY'RE the one's in the wrong!",Just do your job.

A LOT of flexibility... at least amongst the folks I work with (SAs, PDMs)

Good work/life balance... but you have to manage that and make sure you do not overcommit. Also having a good boss helps, of course, but push back if you need to. I have done so very successfully.

Very structured (and GOOD!) onboarding over 3 months that shields you from production demands so you can learn! There is a LOT of content but it is well produced.

Great environment if you like to learn, explore, test, and discover!

Amazing set of folks many of whom were at the top of their games in other organizations

Lots of jobs that support remote work, not just short term, but over the life of the role/job!","Impostor Syndrome - it is real and palpable! Being around such high performers who are knowledgeable can be very intimidating.

You need to manage your own time... AWS is an environment where you kind of act like you run your own company. You won't have a lot of folks telling you what to do. If you can't handle running your own show, and instead prefer a structured tell-me-what-to-do approach, this is not for you.

Working with partners and customers can be challenging as there can be a bunch of twists and turns and things can take longer than desired. Patience and persistence is required!

Especially if you are working remotely, the job can get a bit lonely... so if you are really looking for a lot of interactions with folks, this might not be the role for you

Can sometimes get bombarded with meetings. Work with your team and your leader to set appropriate boundaries and establish enough headroom for you to get your various bits of work done

If you are opposed to being a constant student, this is NOT the role for you. There is ALWAYS something to learn and explore. For folks who feel they need to be comfortable that they know how to do their job, this might NOT be the role for you. Every day is Day 1 at Amazon which means you are constantly working to come up to speed.",Figure out a way to deal with folks who clearly demonstrate a lack of Amazonian leadership principles in an efficient and effective manner.

YMMV depending on manager, rather than your initiative.","Dec 22, 2021",Software Development Engineer,"Austin, TX","Amazon's internal sites training and videos are a treasure trove for growing employees. The Principals of Amazon talks are always informative and well done. Its mentoring program is for *everyone*; if you put in the effort, you will reap the rewards. Regardless of role, your writing skills will get better if you embrace the ""writing culture"". For non-technical employees, Amazon Technical Academy is a great way to make the switch to being a software engineer. Amazon affinity groups are a great place to meet others with common backgrounds, causes, etc.

OG Amazonians have amazing anecdotes about what it was like when Amazon was pioneering some of its now-iconic services like AWS, Prime Now, and Alexa. The insights into the pitfalls of launching new, scalable, and ubiquitous products are invaluable.

Internal transfers are encouraged, alleviate boredom, and allow for expanding skills.

The benefits, though limited in number, are excellent and well-priced (the health care plans are some of the best and least expensive I've had in my 10+ year career).","Managers do not always have management experience or training, so Amazon's policy of allowing an IC to ""try out"" being a manager can backfire. The opaque employee evaluation process requires your manager to advocate on your behalf, but this requires preparation and time that are now under more pressure than ever by projects and other priorities.

Compensation and salary caps that do not adjust for inflation make Amazon less competitive with other employers, particularly when other employers are putting in extra effort to attract and retain talent. As Amazon's culture has changed, the cost of staying has increased while the compensation for staying has decreased or remained stagnant. The ""5th-year cliff"" after hiring incentives (2 years for sign-on, 2 years of RSU vesting) is steep.",Amazon has less on employee growth and retention for far too long.

The point i'm trying to make here, is come into AMAZON at the highest L Rank you can, L3 and below are entry level, L4-L5 are normal supervisors or more technical jobs (unless you're in Seattle, then it's L5-L6). People around here literally leave Amazon for a year, then reapply for higher positions because it's easier then trying to move up internally within that time frame.","Stop hiring out for managers and supervisors when we have perfectly good workers that are ready to move up.

I feel like Amazon had about average pay, the work is simple and repetitive but physically demanding. The only things I can say I dislike for sure is management of peak, sometimes the limits of the entire warehouse would be pushed to the limit that even everyone working hard isn't enough to keep the lines from spilling onto the floor. It can also get very hot in the warehouse, absolutely unsafe if there are no fans on the floor, I think that better AC units should be provided to keep the facilities cool. Another thing is HR isn't very helpful if you have any problems and generally you can feel confused on who to contact for support, and sometimes HR does not do anything.
